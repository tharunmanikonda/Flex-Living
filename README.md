## 📋 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Requirements Met

1. **Hostaway Integration (Mocked)**
   - `/api/reviews/hostaway` endpoint with full filtering capabilities
   - Normalized review data structure
   - Realistic mock data with 8 reviews across 5 properties
   - Handles API credentials (Account ID: 61148)

2. **Manager Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
   - Clean, intuitive interface with performance analytics
   - Advanced filtering by property, channel, rating, approval status
   - Real-time search functionality
   - One-click review approval/rejection
   - Visual statistics cards and trend indicators

3. **Property Display Page** (`/property/[id]`)
   - Replicated Flex Living website aesthetic
   - Only displays manager-approved reviews
   - Rating summaries and category breakdowns
   - Responsive design matching modern web standards

4. **Google Reviews Integration** (`/api/google-reviews`)
   - Complete exploration with technical findings
   - Mock implementation demonstrating data normalization
   - Detailed documentation of limitations and recommendations

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### GET `/api/reviews/hostaway`
Fetch and filter Hostaway reviews with comprehensive query parameters:

**Query Parameters:**
- `includeStats=true` - Include analytics and property statistics
- `propertyId` - Filter by specific property ID
- `channel` - Filter by booking channel (Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo)
- `approved` - Filter by approval status (true/false)
- `minRating` - Filter by minimum rating
- `maxRating` - Filter by maximum rating

**Example:**
```bash
GET /api/reviews/hostaway?includeStats=true&propertyId=101&approved=true
```

### PATCH `/api/reviews/hostaway`
Update review approval status:

```json
{
  "reviewId": 7453,
  "approved": true
}
```

### GET `/api/google-reviews`
Google Reviews integration exploration:

**Query Parameters:**
- `demo=true` - View demo data and integration findings
- `placeId` - Google Place ID for specific location

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Next.js Full-Stack Approach**
- **Why:** Simplified deployment, built-in API routes, excellent developer experience
- **Benefit:** Single codebase, optimized for Vercel, zero-config TypeScript

### 2. **Component-Based Architecture**
- **Dashboard:** Comprehensive filtering and management interface
- **Property Pages:** Public-facing review display with approval workflow
- **API Layer:** RESTful endpoints with proper error handling

### 3. **Data Normalization Strategy**
- Consistent review schema across all channels
- Flexible approval workflow
- Category-based rating breakdowns
- Temporal organization with sorting capabilities

### 4. **UI/UX Design Philosophy**
- **Manager Dashboard:** Data-dense but organized, powerful filtering
- **Property Pages:** Consumer-friendly, trust-building design
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

## 📊 Google Reviews Integration Findings

### ✅ **Feasibility: Technically Possible**

**Implementation Approach:**
- Google Places API for review data retrieval
- Data normalization to match internal schema
- Rate limiting and caching considerations

### ⚠️ **Key Limitations**
1. **Limited Data:** Only 5 most helpful reviews available
2. **No Control:** Cannot select which reviews to display
3. **Rate Limits:** 1000 requests/day on free tier
4. **No Approval Workflow:** All Google reviews are public
5. **Place ID Requirement:** Need mapping for each property

### 💡 **Recommendations**
- Use as supplementary data alongside Hostaway reviews
- Implement caching to respect API limits
- Consider Google My Business API for better control
- Map internal property IDs to Google Place IDs
- Monitor usage and implement fallbacks

**Demo Available:** `/api/google-reviews?demo=true`
